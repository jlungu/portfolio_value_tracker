# Portfolio Tracker
### A simple tool to track your investment portfolio against any major indicies
- This short little python code takes in your portfolio as a csv file, parses your holdings, and compares your stock performance
  against any of the major stock indicies. It generates data you can then graph in another csv file
  
  
- Currently in progress. Bulk of the code complete, logistics/user input is needed to be implemented.
